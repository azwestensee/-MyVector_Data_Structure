# MyVector_Data_Structure
This program basically works as an ArrayList except the capacity is more variable and usually has a couple extra spaces ready to be filled. The program also allows it for any data type to be added within, thus the use of generics. The MyVector class gives you plenty of methods to edit this data structure such as trimming the empty spaces off an array, adding data at a specific index or at the end, removing specific data, etc.
